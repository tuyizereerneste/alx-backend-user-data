0x00. Personal data

Personal data is a broader term that encompasses both PII and non-PII. It includes any information relating to an identifiable person, directly or indirectly.

PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information. It refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. This includes information such as name, email address, social security number, phone number, and biometric data.

Non-PII, on the other hand, stands for Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This type of data cannot be used on its own to identify a specific individual. Examples include demographic information such as age, gender, and location, as well as browser cookies and IP addresses (in some contexts).
